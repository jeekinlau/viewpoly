Other changes since version 0.1.0

* Bug fixed in VIEWgenome module
* Add GitHub link in DESCRIPTION
* Add tutorial video link
* Update README.md

Thank you for reviewing our re-submission!

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

There are two NOTEs that appeared when running some checks. The first one indicates possible misspelled words. However, those words are all spelled correctly, so this NOTE is a false positive.
