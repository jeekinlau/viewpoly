# First submission of VIEWpoly (12-15-2021)

## Maintainer comments

Dear CRAN Team,

I am submitting the first release version of VIEWpoly. The package implements cutting-edge resources to visualize and integrate different sources of genetic analysis, such as linkage and QTL mapping, together with genomic information for autopolyploid species. The package provides an easy-to-use platform for exploitation of results, and is meant to be renderized and interactively used by the user.

We have read the 'CRAN Repository Policies' and followed the 'Writing R Extensions' guide when developing and adjusting the package for submission. VIEWpoly is under constant development and improvement, and I commit myself to maintain the package on CRAN, provide regular updates, and make any other necessary adjustments in a timely manner.

I appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing this submission.

Thank you!

Best regards,

Cristiane Hayumi Taniguti
VIEWpoly maintainer

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 note

There are two NOTEs that appeared when running some checks. The first one indicates possible misspelled words. However, those words are all spelled correctly, so this NOTE is a false positive. The second NOTE stats the maintainer feasibility. We assume that this appears since it is a new package submission.

* This is a new release.
